# EDA Weekend Challenge #1 Salary Calculator

## Description

A salary calculator was created from scratch. HTML, CSS, and JS files were created and linked. A form that takes in 5 inputs was hardcoded to the HTML. Using JS, each entry from the form is appended to the DOM. It sums and logs a running total of monthly salary of each employee and alerts when it is over $20,000. The delete button removes the entry, while also updating the total on the DOM.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, JS, and VSCode
